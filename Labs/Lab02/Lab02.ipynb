    "In Lab 1, we learned about unit testing. We were able to create and locally run our unit tests. Now we will shift to using Travis to continuously test our code against the unit tests. This rest of this section is based off instructions from [Part 5](https://bmcfee.github.io/ismir2018-oss-tutorial/tutorial/2018/08/12/part-5.html) of McFee and Kell's Open MIR Tutorial. \n",

    "For this part, I have created an assignment called `lab2-travis`. Just as you did for Lab 0, please click on [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/qXz4EMwu) and create your own local repository. In this repo, you will find three files:\n",
    "1. `.gitignore`,\n",
    "2. `requirements.txt`, and \n",
    "3. `.travis.yml`. \n",
    "This second hidden file \"tells the Travis servers what to do with your code - in our case, just run the tests\" says [McFee and Kell](https://bmcfee.github.io/ismir2018-oss-tutorial/tutorial/2018/08/12/part-5.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Add your two python files from lab 1 (not the jupyter notebooks) and the data file to this directory. Commit your changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to trace your repository on Travis:\n",
    "1. Visit https://travis-ci.org/profile/<your-github-user-name>. You will list of repositories, and `lab2-travis` will not be there. \n",
    "2. All the repos for this class, including `lab2-travis`, are private. Right below your github name, you will see **Repositories** and a note that reads \"We're only showing your public repositories. You can find your private projects on travis-ci.com .\" Click the travis-ci.com link. \n",
    "3. You should now see a panel on the left side that has \"My Repositories\" and \"Running (#/#)\" at the top. Click on the \"Running\" link, you should see yellow text and your repo. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Travis uses color to tell you want is happening:    \n",
    "<font color='yellow'>**Yellow**</font> means that Travis is thinking   \n",
    "<font color='red'>**Red**</font> means that either the build or the tests have failed   \n",
    "<font color='green'>**Green**</font> means that the build and the tests have worked!    \n",
    "\n",
    "For Travis to \"build\" things correctly, you will need to have both `requirements.txt` and `.travis.yml`. The later has three parts. As [McFee and Kell](https://bmcfee.github.io/ismir2018-oss-tutorial/tutorial/2018/08/12/part-5.html) summarize \"The `install` block handles the gruntwork of installing everything, and the `script` block is what Travis runs. We currently just run `pytest`.\" The `requirements.txt` file adds the packages that we need in our python environment. \n",

MATLAB is optimized for matrix and vector operations, but unlike python, it is not freely available. Along with its powerful computational tools, MATLAB can create data-based images. As the transition away from MATLAB and towards python began, there was a need for all the functionality of MATLAB to exist within python. So the creation and popularity of `matplotlib` makes a lot of historical sense. \n",
