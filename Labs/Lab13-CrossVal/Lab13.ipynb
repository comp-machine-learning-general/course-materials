Recalling that the goal of any machine learning algorithm is to uncover some underlying truth about our data, in seeking this truth, we can't rely on having the \"right\" training data. Instead, we need to have methods that are robust to variations in our data; in other words, we want to feel confident that our discoveries are good regardless of the data that we train on. \n",
