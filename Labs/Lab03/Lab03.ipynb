When we say \"supervision\", we do not mean human supervised task; rather, we mean whether we are using outcomes to teach our algorithms (supervised machine learning) or (unsupervised machine learning). Most courses and texts begin with supervised learning, but in our course, we will begin with unsupervised learning. The most classic of the unsupervised learning algorithms is **k-means**. \n",
