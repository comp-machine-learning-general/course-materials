    "There are two other notebooks in this directory. One shows you how I created the fake data and the second is my scratch work for the second half of the lab. I am including both here so that you can see what happens \"behind the scenes\" if you choose. Neither notebook are as well annotated as this one, nor are they ones that I would call \"final drafts.\" They are mostly notes that I used to create the notebook that you use for the lab. "
