From a computational point of view, we also want to limit the maximum number of steps. However, we want to take enough steps that we reach the minimum, but not so many that we by-pass that minimum. \n",

    "Now find a minima, and lay your pencil down such that the side of the pencil (ie. neither \"end\" of the pencil) touches the curve in one place. Notice that your pencil is parallel to the $x$ axis, or as we say, it's _flat._ Your pencil is a physical representative of the derivative. If we were to do something similar for an evaluation surface, we would use a board in place of the pencil. In this higher dimensional version, the board will be parallel to the parameter plane. \n",

    "Last time we talked about the number of MSE computations for grid search. Clearly gradient descent lowers the number of MSE computations, but within each MSE computation, there are also a number of computations dictated by the size of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset has 1000 employees. For each computation of MSE for our example, how many arithmatic operations occur? Think about the _order_ of operations as you do this. Try to express your number in terms of $n_o$ the number of observations, $n_v$ the number of variables, and/or the $n_p$ the number of parameters.  \n",

    "### Stochastic Gradient Descent \n",

    "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) attempts to overcome the number of computations within the MSE by using just one randomly chosen datapoint for each step of the gradient descent. The gradient descent that we implemented earlier is also called _batch gradient descent_ because it consults a _batch_ of data, instead of just one datapoint, in the decision of where to step. \n",

    "Create an implementation of stochastic gradient descent, where for each step, you randomly select one datapoint to act in place of the dataset. This means that you are *only using one* data point for computing **both** MSE and for computing the gradient. Before you get started, a few hints and warnings:\n",
