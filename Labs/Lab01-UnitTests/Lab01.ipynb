    "   * Type `vim .gitignore`   \n",
    "     Now you will see an empty file. If you try to type right now, nothing will happen until you hit the **i** key. This is confusing at first. But **i** is a special key in _vim_ as we will discuss next. \n",
    "   * Enter **insert mode** by typing `i`. Now you can type whatever you want. Since, we want to ignore our _.ipynb_ checkpoints, add `.ipynb_checkpoints` to your _.gitignore_ file. \n",
    "   * Exiting a file in _vim_ is not as simple as closing the window. First, we need to get out of _edit/insert_ mode and back to command mode. To do this hit `Esc`. \n",
