Although, you may hear of other specifications where someone says that their data has only 5% non-zero values. \n",

American, fusion, etc), another for whether they are open for breakfast (ie. yes or no), another for open for brunch, another for lunch, and another for dinner. We could have indicator variables (ie. ones with either \"yes\" or \"no\" for choices) for hundred options. For many of these options, restaurants may only have \"yes\" for a handful of them, and thus the data is likely _sparse_. \n",
