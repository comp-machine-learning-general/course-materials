    "It can be very surprising that the training and testing errors can vary so wildly depending on what data is in the training set and what data is in the testing set. This is because of the _variance_ that is inherent in any model about data, due to the variations in data. Recalling that the goal of any machine learning algorithm is to uncover some underlying truth about our data, in seeking this truth, we can't rely on having the \"right\" training data. Instead, we need to have methods that are robust to variations in our data; in other words, we want to feel confident that our discoveries are good regardless of the data that we train on. \n",

    "Our goal with the `mystery_data` is to uncover the polynomial relationship between `mysty` and `myst`. In Lab 12, we divided our data into train and test. Then for degrees between 1 and 10, we used the training data to find a polynomial relationship, and used the testing set to see how this found relationship might generalize to new data. We noticed a few things:\n",

Then in the first part of this lab, we investigated which part of the data is the \"right\" training data.
